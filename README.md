# Project Title

Convene

## Overview

This app is designed to help a user plan a hangout by suggesting places such as cafes and restaurants, along with the bus each person should take and the stop they will get off at. Currently, it is made for people in Vancouver, Burnaby, New Westminster, Coquitlam, Port Coquitlam, Port Moody, Richmond, Surrey, Delta, Tsawwassen, North Vancouver, West Vancouver, and Langley.

### Problem Space

To help people plan their meeting spots and make it accessible for both people, especially for those who rely on public transit.

It is sometimes challenging for people to decide on the optimal meeting location for hangouts. More so for commuters, as their destinations are limited by the transit options that are available to them. Inspired by this, my app eases the burden of searching for places that close to transit stops, along with being easily accessible from two starting locations using public transit in Metro Vancouver. Also to encourage the use of public transit, for the environment ðŸ˜Š.

### User Profile

A user wants to find places to hang out with their friend in Metro Vancouver, assuming the user knows the friendâ€™s address. The user wants to use public trasnsit to find locations that are accessible for themselves and their friend using direct transit (no transfers).

### Features

User Manual:

1. Enter two locations (i.e your home address and your friend's home address) in the input fields.
2. Click the Submit button. It will take you to the Search page.
3. On the Search page you will see the two starting locations.
4. Under each location, you will see a list of routes that are within 500 meters of the starting location. This is the Routes section of the Search Page.
5. You will select one route from Location A list and one route from Location B list and click Submit. This will display the Stops section on the page, below the Routes section.
6. The Stops section will display a list of stop pairs, which is the destination stop from each location on the selected route.
7. You will click a stop pair button which will display the Places section below the Stops section, on the same page.
8. The Places section displays a list of cafes and restaurants that are within 500 meters of the stop pairs.
9. If there are more than one stop pair available, you may click on a different stop pair to see the locations in that area
10. If there are no stop pairs available for the chosen location, or if you would like to browse a different route, you may scroll up and select a different route.
