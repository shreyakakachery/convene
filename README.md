# Project Title

Convene

## Overview

This app is designed to help a user plan a hangout by suggesting places such as cafes and restaurants, along with the bus each person should take and the stop they will get off at. Currently, it is made for people in Vancouver, Burnaby, New Westminster, Coquitlam, Port Coquitlam, Port Moody, Richmond, Surrey, Delta, Tsawwassen, North Vancouver, West Vancouver, and Langley.

### Problem Space

To help people plan their meeting spots and make it accessible for both people, especially for those who rely on public transit.

It is sometimes challenging for people to decide on the optimal meeting location for hangouts. More so for commuters, as their destinations are limited by the transit options that are available to them. Inspired by this, my app eases the burden of searching for places that close to transit stops, along with being easily accessible from two starting locations using public transit in Metro Vancouver. Also to encourage the use of public transit, for the environment ðŸ˜Š.

### User Profile

A user wants to find places to hang out with their friend in Metro Vancouver, assuming the user knows the friendâ€™s address. The user wants to use public trasnsit to find locations that are accessible for themselves and their friend using direct transit (no transfers).

### Features

User Manual:

1. Enter two locations (i.e your home address and your friend's home address) in the input fields and click 'Get Stops'. It will take you to the Routes page.
2. On the Routes page you will see the two starting locations. Under each location, you will see a list of routes that are within 500 meters of the starting location. This will take you to the Stops Page.
3. You will select one route from the first and one route from the second list and click 'Get Stops'. This will take you to the Places Page.
4. You will see a list of Intersection cards, which displays a destination stop from each location on the selected route. These are points where the two selected routes intersect.
5. You will select an Intersection card, and click 'Get Places' which will display the Places. You can also visualize the places on the interactive map. Clicking a Place card will highlight its location on the map as a pink star. Use the link provided on the Place card to discover mode details about the place.
6. The Places section displays a list of cafes and restaurants that are within 500 meters of the stop pairs.
7. You may click the back button present on every page to change your selection or address.
